This is my project for the Individual Assessment for IB Computer Science, which dates back to December 2023.

The goal of this project was to create an interface that facilitates students setting up meetings with their university counsellors. 
I've also added a folder with documentation of the different stages I went through in order to achieve the end product, for those who are curious. 
Within this folder is also a video of the program in action! Hope you enjoy.
